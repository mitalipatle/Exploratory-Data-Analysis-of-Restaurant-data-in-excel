# Exploratory Data Analysis of Restaurant data in excel

## Introduction:

Being a major food enthusiast and a food and beverage server in one of the restaurants in Ireland, I am accustomed to receiving regular meal orders from patrons. This raises a lot of questions in my mind regarding the restaurant's business. I came upon a nice dataset about restaurants and orders and what would have deterred a data geek from exploring it on the route to this search. This project is an example of how my data science expertise and passion in the topic come together in a simple yet intriguing way. I was able to use Excel to its fullest extent thanks to this assignment, and the insights I gained from it have provided many answers.



## Scope:

##### 1). Data Cleaning and formatting.
##### 2). Administered functions like IFs, VLOOKUPS to projects information on restauarants,cuisines along with final sales by restauarnts after discount.
##### 3). Utilisation of pivot tables to summarize information and answering to important questions through visualisation.

## Data Used:
The data used in the project is taken from kaggle which consists of two tables that carries information on restaurants and orders. The orders and restaurants dataset represents 500 rows, 10 columns and 20 rows,5 columns respectively. 

## Data cleaning and formatting:
To make it simple to sort, filter, and format data, the orders dataset is first transformed into a table. The dataset was examined for the existence of blank cells and null values in order to clean it up. The columns were then given proper names, and any unnecessary columns were removed. The columns received the correct data formatting and had any duplicate values checked.

## Function Utilisation:
Every consumer who placed an order for food worth â‚¹500 or more is entitled to a 5% discount. In order to identify those who are qualified for a discount, the IF function is used in conjunction with the column to construct a column with a discount.

Similar to this, the VLOOKUP function is used to find the values from the restaurant table using the restaurant id as a reference in order to include restaurant names and cuisines served by them in the orders table.

## Data Analysis:

**1).Total sales of each restaurant after discount.**

Description:The pivot table provided a summary of the total sales made by each restaurant after allowing eligible customers to receive discounts. The visualisation makes use of a horizontal bar graph. Considering an equal investment made by each restaurant, it can be shown that Veer Restaurant has the most and Vrinda Bhavan has the lowest total sales, respectively.

**Results:**

**2). Average delivery time of each restaurant.**

Description:The pivot table showed the average delivery time for each restaurant, with Ruchi having the longest average delivery time and The Cave Hotel having the shortest. The interesting thing to note is that there is only an 8-minute difference between these two restaurants. To display average delivery times in ascending order, a vertical bar graph is used.

**3). Popular cuisine and the preferred method of payment.**

Description: A pivot table displays the proportion of ordered food based on cuisine and payment method, sorted in ascending order. North Indian and Chinese cuisine are the most favored by customers, while Arabian cuisine is the least preferred. The most common method of payment is Debit Card, followed closely by Cash on Delivery, with credit card being the least used. A donut and a pie chart are utilized to visually represent the data.

**4). Average customer ratings for food and delivery services.**

Conversely, Win Hotel has the lowest customer rating, and Denver Restaurant has the lowest delivery rating.

**5).A time series plot for ordered quantity.** 

Description:The pivot table displays the quantity of orders made in various time slots. The data is displayed through a time series line chart, revealing that the peak number of orders occurred from 2 to 3 PM, likely due to it being lunchtime, while the fewest orders were made between 10-11 PM.
