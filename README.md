# Restaurant-data-analysis-in-excel

## Introduction:

Being a major foody and a food and beverage server in one of the restaurants in Ireland , I am use to ordering food and being ordered by customers on a regular basis. This makes me questions a lot of things about the restaurants buisness. On my way to this search , I came across a wonderful dataset about restaurants and orders and what could have stopped a data scientist to explore it. This project is a representation of simple yet an interesting combination of my skills as a data scientist and my curosity on the subject.This project has helped me unlock my hidden potential on excel and the insights drawn from this project has answered lot of my questions and might answer yours too.
