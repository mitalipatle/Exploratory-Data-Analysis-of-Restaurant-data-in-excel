# Restaurant-data-analysis-in-excel

## Introduction:

Being a major food enthusiast and a food and beverage server in one of the restaurants in Ireland, I am accustomed to receiving regular meal orders from patrons. This raises a lot of questions in my mind regarding the restaurant's business. I came upon a nice dataset about restaurants and orders and what would have deterred a data geek from exploring it on the route to this search. This project is an example of how my data science expertise and passion in the topic come together in a simple yet intriguing way. I was able to use Excel to its fullest extent thanks to this assignment, and the insights I gained from it have provided many answers.

##### 1). Data Cleaning and formatting.
##### 2). Administered functions like IFs, VLOOKUPS to projects information on restauarants,cuisines along with final sales by each restauarnts after discount.
